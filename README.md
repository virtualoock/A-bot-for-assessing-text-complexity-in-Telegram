Telegram Bot Setup:

The script uses the python-telegram-bot library to interact with the Telegram Bot API. It sets up a basic Telegram bot with a command handler for the "/start" command and a message handler for analyzing text.
Text Analysis:

The analyze_text function is triggered when the bot receives a text message. It extracts the text from the message and uses the flesch_kincaid_grade function from the textstat library to calculate the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of the text.
The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level is a measure of readability that estimates the U.S. school grade level needed to understand a particular text. It takes into account factors such as sentence length and the number of syllables per word.
Response:

The bot then replies to the user with the calculated grade, indicating the estimated level of education required to understand the given text.
Telegram Bot Execution:

The main function initializes the bot using the provided token and sets up the necessary handlers. The bot continuously polls for new messages using updater.start_polling().
Textstat Library:

The textstat library is used for text analysis and provides various readability metrics. In this example, we use the flesch_kincaid_grade function, but the library offers other functions like flesch_reading_ease, automated_readability_index, etc.
To use the library, it must be installed via pip install textstat.
